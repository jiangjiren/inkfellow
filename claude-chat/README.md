# inkfellow AI Service (`claude-chat`)

`claude-chat` is the local AI backend and embedded panel used by inkfellow. It serves a static chat UI, streams agent events over WebSocket, keeps local history and provider profiles, runs scheduled jobs, and can connect the active agent to WeChat.

It supports two native subscription runtimes:

- Claude through `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` and the current user's Claude Code login.
- Codex through `@openai/codex-sdk` and the current user's Codex/ChatGPT login.

Anthropic-compatible API providers are routed through the Claude runtime with provider-specific environment settings.

## Requirements

- Node.js 20.9 or newer when used with the main inkfellow project
- npm
- A vault directory
- Claude Code and/or Codex login if using subscription accounts

## Standalone Setup

```bash
cd claude-chat
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm start
```

PowerShell equivalent:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm.cmd start
```

Minimal `.env`:

```dotenv
HOST=127.0.0.1
PORT=8082
VAULT_PATH=/absolute/path/to/your/vault
CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE=auto
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8082> to inspect the standalone panel. In the main app, Next.js exposes it at `/notes-claude/` and proxies WebSocket traffic to this port.

## Provider Authentication

### Claude subscription

Install Claude Code and log in as the same OS user that runs this service. If needed, start `claude` and use its `/login` command. Verify the result with:

```bash
claude auth status
```

The service uses the Claude Agent SDK default credential discovery. Credentials may be stored in the system keychain, so checking only `~/.claude/.credentials.json` is not reliable. Do not set a third-party `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` in the service environment when the Claude subscription profile should use the official login.

### Codex / ChatGPT subscription

Log in through Codex Desktop or the CLI as the service user:

```bash
codex login
```

The service exposes the Codex profile only when `~/.codex/auth.json` contains usable login data. Codex conversations use persistent thread IDs and map inkfellow permission modes to Codex sandbox modes.

### API providers

Add accounts from the panel settings:

| Provider | Default endpoint behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Anthropic | Official Anthropic API; API key required. |
| DeepSeek | Anthropic-compatible DeepSeek endpoint and preset model mapping. |
| OpenRouter | OpenRouter Anthropic-compatible endpoint and configurable model mapping. |
| MiniMax | MiniMax Anthropic-compatible endpoint and preset model mapping. |
| Custom | User-supplied Anthropic-compatible base URL, key, and model mapping. |

Profiles can be added, edited, activated, and removed in the UI. Claude is always retained as a built-in profile; Codex is injected when a login is available. Exact model IDs come from the current profile instead of being fixed by this README.

## Agent Controls

The panel supports:

- Model selection and provider-specific reasoning/effort levels.
- `plan`, `acceptEdits`, `auto`, and `bypassPermissions` modes.
- Streaming text, thinking, tool use/results, cost/usage events, and interactive questions.
- New, resume, rename, and delete operations for locally stored conversations.
- Image attachments. Codex attachments are materialized as temporary local image files before SDK submission.
- Skills discovered from the current user's Claude or Codex skill directories and the vault-local skill directories.

Permission behavior is provider-specific. `bypassPermissions` is the broadest mode and should be enabled only in a trusted, single-user environment.

## Scheduled Jobs

The built-in scheduler supports cron jobs and future one-off jobs. A job can:

- Add its result to chat history.
- Ask the agent to create a dated Markdown note.
- Ask the agent to append to a specified note.
- Deliver a result back to the source channel.

The chat agent receives scheduler tools when the request looks like a reminder or automation request. REST clients can also manage jobs through `/api/cron/jobs`.

Cron time zones are stored per job and default to `Asia/Shanghai`. One-off times use a future Unix timestamp in milliseconds. Schedules, state, and run logs live in `CLAUDE_CHAT_DATA_DIR`.

At present, WeChat is the only registered external delivery adapter. References in source comments to Feishu or Telegram are extension points, not implemented channels.

## WeChat Connection

The settings panel can start a QR-code login flow. After confirmation, the service stores the bot token locally, starts a background polling loop, and can receive and send text or media messages. Scheduled tasks created from a WeChat conversation can deliver results to the originating peer.

WeChat state and downloaded media are stored below `CLAUDE_CHAT_DATA_DIR`. Treat the bot configuration as a credential. The integration depends on the configured Tencent iLink endpoints and should not be exposed as an unauthenticated public API.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Listener address. Keep loopback unless another trusted network layer protects the service. |
| `PORT` | `8082` | HTTP and WebSocket port. |
| `VAULT_PATH` | process working directory | Default and maximum allowed agent working directory. |
| `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` | `auto` | Initial permission mode: `plan`, `acceptEdits`, `auto`, or `bypassPermissions`. |
| `CLAUDE_CHAT_DATA_DIR` | `claude-chat/data` | Sessions, history, schedules, run logs, WeChat state, media, and Codex thread data. |
| `CLAUDE_CHAT_AUTH_PROFILE_FILE` | `claude-chat/auth-profile.json` | Provider profiles and API keys. |
| `CLAUDE_CHAT_HISTORY_FILE` | `<data dir>/history.json` | Optional override for the merged conversation history file. |
| `DESKTOP_AGENT_TOKEN` | empty | Tauri-only access token for embedded HTTP/WebSocket requests. Set by the desktop host, not by normal deployments. |
| `WECHAT_CDN_BASE_URL` | Tencent CDN URL | Override for WeChat media downloads. |
| `WECHAT_MAX_INLINE_IMAGE_BYTES` | `5242880` | Maximum image size embedded directly into an agent request. |
| `WECHAT_MAX_MEDIA_BYTES` | `26214400` | Maximum inbound or outbound WeChat media size. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | empty | Optional inherited credentials for the default Claude runtime. UI profiles are preferred for multiple accounts. |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and model variables | provider/runtime defaults | Optional inherited Claude-compatible runtime overrides. Avoid stale global overrides when switching UI profiles. |

`CLAUDE_CHAT_SESSION_FILE` is not a runtime setting in the current server implementation; session state is stored under `CLAUDE_CHAT_DATA_DIR` using the service port. Use `CLAUDE_CHAT_HISTORY_FILE` only when conversation history must live at a custom path.

## Local Data

Default runtime files include:

```text
claude-chat/auth-profile.json       provider profiles and API keys
claude-chat/data/history.json       merged chat history
claude-chat/data/session-<port>.json
claude-chat/data/codex-thread-<port>.json
claude-chat/data/schedules-<port>.json
claude-chat/data/schedules-state-<port>.json
claude-chat/data/runs/               scheduler run logs
claude-chat/data/wechat-*            WeChat credentials, sync state, history, and media
```

These paths are ignored by the repository's `.gitignore`. Keep them private, include them deliberately in backups, and protect backups at rest.

## HTTP and WebSocket Surface

The service exposes the panel and a small local API:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/` and static files | Embedded chat UI. |
| `/api/health/claude-auth` | Claude CLI login status. |
| `/api/health/codex-auth` | Codex login status. |
| `/api/usage-limits` | Best-effort Claude/Codex subscription usage windows. |
| `/api/auth-profile` | Read and manage provider profiles. Secret values are masked in GET responses. |
| `/api/history` | List and manage local conversation history. |
| `/api/cron/jobs` | List, create, enable/disable, and delete scheduled jobs. |
| `/api/cron/jobs/once` | Create a future one-off job. |
| `/api/wechat/*` | WeChat status, QR login, polling, and logout. |
| WebSocket upgrade | Agent messages, streaming events, cancellation, and interactive question responses. |

This API is designed for the local inkfellow UI, not as a hardened public service.

## Reverse Proxy

For local development, the main Next.js app handles `/notes-claude/*` through its built-in rewrite.

For production, `deploy/nginx.conf.example` proxies `/notes-claude/` directly to this service and includes the required WebSocket headers. The trailing slash in `proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8082/` strips the public prefix before forwarding.

Recommended boundaries:

- Bind this service to `127.0.0.1`.
- Require authentication at Nginx or another trusted gateway.
- Preserve `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers.
- Use long read/send timeouts for agent streams.
- Run the process as the same user that owns the selected subscription credentials and vault.

## Desktop Embedding

The Tauri app packages this directory with production dependencies and a Node runtime. At launch it:

1. Chooses a free loopback port.
2. Generates a random `DESKTOP_AGENT_TOKEN`.
3. Sets the selected vault as `VAULT_PATH`.
4. Stores auth profiles and runtime data in the desktop application config directory.
5. Starts `server.js` as a child process and injects the token into the embedded panel URL and WebSocket.

Do not add `.env`, `auth-profile.json`, `data/`, or `node_modules` to the desktop bundle manually; `scripts/prepare-desktop-sidecar.mjs` intentionally excludes and regenerates them.

## Development and Checks

```bash
npm ci
node --check server.js
node --check scheduler.js
npm start
```

There is currently no automated test script in `claude-chat/package.json`; the declared `npm test` intentionally exits with an error. Use syntax checks plus a local service smoke test, then run the root project checks before release.

## Security Checklist

- Never commit `.env`, `auth-profile.json`, `data/`, OAuth files, chat history, or API keys.
- Do not bind to a public interface without a separate authenticated gateway.
- Keep `VAULT_PATH` as narrow as possible. Requested working directories are resolved and constrained below it.
- Use `plan` or `acceptEdits` for cautious deployments; reserve `auto` and especially `bypassPermissions` for trusted users.
- Isolate `CLAUDE_CHAT_DATA_DIR`, profile files, ports, and Unix users when running more than one instance.
- Remember that chat and schedule logs may contain private note excerpts even when no API keys are present.

## Troubleshooting

- **Claude shows logged out:** run `claude auth status` as the exact service user and check its `HOME` and keychain access.
- **Codex profile is missing:** complete `codex login` as the service user and confirm that `~/.codex/auth.json` exists.
- **Panel loads but streaming fails:** preserve WebSocket upgrade headers and make the configured frontend port match the service port.
- **Agent cannot see the vault:** use an absolute `VAULT_PATH` and verify filesystem permissions for the service user.
- **A stale provider endpoint is used:** remove inherited `ANTHROPIC_*` overrides from the process manager, then restart and activate the intended UI profile.
- **Schedules disappear between restarts:** verify that `CLAUDE_CHAT_DATA_DIR` is writable and persistent.
